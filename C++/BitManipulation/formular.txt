x-1 = the rightmost 1 and bits right to it are flipped
eg: x = 100 -> x-1 = 011
(1) x & (x-1) = 0 if x = 2^k
(2) x ^ ( x & (x-1)): 
  Returns the rightmost 1 in binary representation of x.
(3) x & (-x):
  Returns the rightmost 1 in binary representation of x
(4) x | (1 << n):
  Returns the number x with its nth bit set to 1.
