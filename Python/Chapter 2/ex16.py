    we have:
        stop = start + (n-1)*d
        stop-start = (n-1)*d
        (stop-start)/d = n -1
        (stop-start)/d + 1 = n
        is equivalent to that formula if you expand the equations
        we need to use // because it's a index, with is an integer
        0 is use in case of mixed-up params
